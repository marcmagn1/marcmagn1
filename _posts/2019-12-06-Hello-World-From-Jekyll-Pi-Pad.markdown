Et voilÃ ! It's live! ðŸ˜…

It's been a small struggle but I finally managed to complete the workflow I had in mind to produce this first post: 

	- Control a Raspian-powered Raspberry Pi 4 from an Ipad over SSH over USB-C
	- Run Jekyll on the Pi to generate and serve this static website
	- Run samba file-sharing from the Pi to expose the website files over the network and access them from the Ipad native apps
	- Edit the files from Textastic or any other app on the Ipad
	- Access the local preview of the website served locally by the Pi from the Ipad browser

It might seem complex, but when everything has been setup, it's butter-smooth!

The Ipad is lightning-fast, the Pi always available (connected over USB-C, it does not need an internet connection), and the whole setup is super portable.

I know... One would think that the ordeal could be easily avoided if everything was running on a Macbook, Microsoft Surface or anything with a desktop grade OS. Fair enough, one would be right! 

Call me masochist but I beleve that overcoming the  limitations presented by the Ipad and Pi and come up with something that works is interesting enough to justify the oddity of the setup: after all, it's when facing adversity that creativity is fueled! 
And to be frank, it's actually stimulating and focusing to work from IpadOS.

Let me know if you would like a tutorial on the setup.
