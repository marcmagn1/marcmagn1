I"	<p>Et voilÃ ! Itâ€™s live! ðŸ˜…</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been a small struggle but I finally managed to complete the workflow I had in mind to produce this first post:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Control a Raspian-powered Raspberry Pi 4 from an Ipad over SSH over USB-C
- Run Jekyll on the Pi to generate and serve this static website
- Run samba file-sharing from the Pi to expose the website files over the network and access them from the Ipad native apps
- Edit the files from Textastic or any other app on the Ipad
- Access the local preview of the website served locally by the Pi from the Ipad browser
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It might seem complex, but when everything has been setup, itâ€™s butter-smooth!</p>

<p>The Ipad is lightning-fast, the Pi always available (connected over USB-C, it does not need an internet connection), and the whole setup is super portable.</p>

<p>I knowâ€¦ One would think that the ordeal could be easily avoided if everything was running on a Macbook, Microsoft Surface or anything with a desktop grade OS. Fair enough, one would be right!</p>

<p>Call me masochist but I beleve that overcoming the  limitations presented by the Ipad and Pi and come up with something that works is interesting enough to justify the oddity of the setup: after all, itâ€™s when facing adversity that creativity is fueled! 
And to be frank, itâ€™s actually stimulating and focusing to work from IpadOS.</p>

<p>Let me know if you would a tutorial on the setup.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Assess alternatives to Textastic</li>
  <li>Add version control / Working Copy</li>
  <li>Explore IOS shortcut to create new posts / control Jekyll</li>
</ul>
