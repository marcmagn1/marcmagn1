Here you will find my ramblings about topics that I find interesting.

A word of warning: this goes in many directions as I am a huge victim of rabbit holes around the World.

Expect to read articles about anything from programming to travels, including Infosec or Product management, as well as many other topics.

Feel free to reach out for suggestions, feedbacks or just to exchange!
